Great analysis on problem 10!  Vercel sounds like a good tool, and it also
sounds like you are maximizing its strengths!

You have very thoughtful answers to all the opinion questions, too.  I like
what you said in response to problem 8, about telling the customer what you
*CAN* have done by the deadline.  That helps to put a positive spin on the
"bad news".  You guys are really thinking like software engineers now!

In problem 5, I generally agree with your answer, but there may be times for
which you HAVE to make an assumption, apart from customer rep availability.
Sometimes it's OK to assume, based on the risk profile that might result.

Great job on this assignment!
