==============================
Presentation:
   your presentation was excellent, and the slides are great.  the social
   media component is a great idea to help people get [and stay!] involved.
   there is often a surge at the start of some major event which then begins
   to retreat as time moves on; having the social aspect should help prevent
   the "two steps forward and one step back" syndrome, IMHO.

Proposal Document:
   EXCELLENT work on this.  even though it isn't *exactly* done the way the
   proposal requirement specified, I like this better ~~ it is clear, it is
   described in a way that is easily understood, and the features section
   shows good thought behind the project.

Nice work on this presentation and proposal!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus
