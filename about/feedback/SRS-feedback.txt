=====================================================================================
VERY nice job on this document.  I like that you have put the entire SDF into
a single document.  That will make it easier to maintain, and also should
help with making sure that things are consistent across sections.

The schedule is very well done, and it's impressive that you elected to use
the PERT chart approach!  You've done a MOST EXCELLENT job of handling the
complexities of that method and it's quite clear, based on the table you've
included what each of the tasks will do and where they will fit in the
overall development process!

One thing you will see in the industry, especially if the sections are split
apart into separate documents, is that in section 5.1 you'll find a brief
re-cap of what the project is.  In your case, perhaps part of the first
paragraph of your proposal document.  Don't worry about that here, though.

This is a stellar document!  You have really captured the intent here!  The
one place that needs some additional information is the Server CSC.  What
you can/should add to that section is what the data structures will look
like in the communications between the front end and the back end.  Will you
have to do any translation from what is sent by the front end to what is
processed by the back end?  What information is in those data structures?
Will the communication be over TCP/IP link?  Does the application need to
specify a host address and port number to connect?  There are a myriad of
items that you can [and probably should] specify here, unless it is all
transparent even to the development team in the fact that you are using
Next.js and Flask.  If that is the case, then modify 5.3.2.1 to say that
"Because the server application is using Next.js and Flask, the details of
transmission between the front and back ends is hidden and requires no other
specification here."  Kind of a cop-out, but it works, if that's the case.

Other than that, GREAT JOB!!!
