=====================================================================================
Another great effort on this deliverable!

Your description is, of course, excellent.  I love the screen views which show
examples [how did you know I love pancakes?!].  Your diagrams are perfect for
the level needed for architectural view.

One very minor point: the color in the diagram boxes is very pleasing, but
white text doesn't show too well, so it's a bit harder to read.


Another outstanding work product!!  EXCELLENT!!
