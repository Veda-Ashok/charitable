Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
Another great effort on this deliverable!

Your description is, of course, excellent.  I love the screen views which show
examples [how did you know I love pancakes?!].  Your diagrams are perfect for
the level needed for architectural view.

One very minor point: the color in the diagram boxes is very pleasing, but
white text doesn't show too well, so it's a bit harder to read.


Another outstanding work product!!  EXCELLENT!!

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Excellent work here, as well.  Wonderful detail and I feel like if I were to
be given this design I could start coding right away!  The color coding on
the diagram is very helpful, and your ER diagram is perfect in its detail.

One thing to note, perhaps, is that "strictly speaking" since you are using
Mongo for your database, this isn't *actually* an ERD, since it's relational.
However, you communicate the ideas effectively by using the JSON objects you
show, so that's fine.

All told, great job!

         Note that the "CDR presentation is folded into "ABCDR"
            so the 15% reflects 10% for detail and 5% for CDR
