# Charitable

## Charitable Project Proposal

### What is Charitable?

Charitable is a web application that raises awareness for humanitarian causes and provides opportunities for users to give back to their community. We want to create a space where users can learn about legitimate organizations that they can donate to or volunteer at.

Charitable can best be described as “LinkedIn” for charities. Charitable models the web application known as Charity Navigator, but adds an element of social media to promote and encourage involvement. 

The application will display information on each organization that outlines what the organization does, why their cause is important, what donations are used for, and what the organization has accomplished. The information provided for each organization will answer the same set of guiding questions so that users can easily understand the difference between each charity.


#### Most Important Features: 

Charitable’s most important features include: 
##### 1. The Search Engine: 
  - users can research specific causes, learn about new causes, and find organizations that they are interested in
  
##### 2. The Trending Page: 
  - users can discover popular global causes and organizations in the nation
  
##### 3. User Profile: 
  - users maintain a profile with which they can save their favorite charities and other opportunities
  
##### 4. Creating a Social Media Environment
  - users have the ability to connect with other users and share charities and opportunities with each other
  - users can create “events” (donations or volunteer plans) that other users can join from official organizations on the app 


#### Hardware/Software it requires:

To use this application, any device that can run a web browser is required. Users will also need a web browser.

For developmental purposes, we may use the Charity Navigator API to aid us in accessing data about charities. Our application will be developed using React and we will utilize VS Code to collaborate on our work. We will use a SCRUM development framework to manage our tasks. To do this, we will use Jira. We will also use Adobe XD to create prototypes and mock-ups of our ideas.

### Who is Charitable?

Charitable is for people in the U.S. who have the means to donate their time or money, and want to make a positive contribution to society. Users are also likely people who are comfortable navigating social media.

### Why Charitable?

Charitable means a lot to all of our team’s members- we wanted to embrace LMU’s value of service and create a way to make it easier to give back. 

From a developmental standpoint, we can apply our learnings from Databases, Networks, Interaction Design, and UI/UX Design. We are excited to use this opportunity to utilize each of our strengths and also expand our skill sets. This project will help us understand what software development is like in industry. Our workflow plan organizes our tasks such that we challenge ourselves to learn, but also make the work manageable so that we stay motivated. We are aiming to complete this project within a semester’s timeframe.

We are looking forward to making your day for Charitable.
