          "California is battling wildfires at a historic scale this season. A heat wave and lightning sparked the second-largest fire in the state's history in late August 2020, with hundreds of smaller fires burning across multiple counties. Homes have been destroyed and more than 100,000 residents are displaced. The COVID-19 pandemic is an added challenge for first responders and residents, with the threat of infection remaining high, particularly in shelters where social distancing is challenging.",
        longTermImpact:
          'We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of natural disasters like wildfires. By funding the relief and recovery efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future challenges. GlobalGiving will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors.',
        activities:
          "All donations to this fund will support relief and recovery efforts for Californians affected by the 2020 wildfires. Initially, the fund will help first responders meet survivors' immediate needs for food, fuel, clean water, medicine, and shelter. The fund will transition to support longer-term recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in the region. We monitor the impact on affected communities and work with partners on the ground to allocate funds to where they're needed most.",

The InvestEGGator is a decoy sea turtle egg embedded with a GPS tracker. We need your help to distribute these eggs so that the conservationists can use them to track the illegal trade of sea turtle eggs. Sea turtles are threatened with extinction, especially the leatherback and hawksbill turtles that nest in Central America.',

          "Wildlife poaching is a major threat to the survival of endangered species across the world, particularly affecting large, slow-to-reproduce vertebrates such as sea turtles. In Latin America, sea turtle eggs are prized as a delicacy and aphrodisiac and are often stolen. Documenting the eggs' trade routes can enable law enforcement officials to disrupt wildlife crime at the trade network level. However, until now, it has proven near impossible to collect reliable data on this clandestine activity.",
        longTermImpact:
          'The InvestEGGator will allow users to locate frequently used storage facilities; document transit routes, border crossings, and means of concealment; document temporal patterns in movement; and provide evidence to local and regional law enforcement to facilitate arrests and prosecutions of key participants in wildlife trade. By supporting this project, donors will be able to make this powerful tool available to sea turtle conservationists around the world.',
        activities:
          "Paso Pacifico has developed the InvestEGGator: a realistic, artificial sea turtle egg containing a GPS tracker that transmits locations in real-time using cellular networks. The 3D printed egg is pliable, water-resistant, and closely resembles a real turtle egg in look, weight, and feel. These fake eggs can be planted in nests vulnerable to poaching and then provide, real-time geographic data on the eggs' movements, from the nesting beach to the final market.",

Our communities, the indigenous Wayuu, live in the middle of the desert, without electricity, lack of water, and poor access to basic education and healthcare. . Around 70% of the population does not speak Spanish, Colombia's official language, which makes it very difficult for them to earn an income. Additionally, due to the patriarchal culture in this community, most women are excluded from proper education and are ill-treated.",

This project will train more than 200 mothers and it will also provide a job and an income for their families. The net profit of selling the mochilas will be used to solve pending problems in the community, build a primary school, provide school transport for middle and high school students (the schools are 40 minutes away by car) and provide COVID-19',

Bags are sold in a good price internationally, especially in Korea and they give income to families. And these 3 communities got medicine and health care, school supplies, solar lamps, and food during quarantine of COVID. Cultivo de amor provides opportunity to sell and to find buyers, and they will be taught Spanish, marketing and decision making.',

Since November 2018, we have trialed a waste management system in Siring Bukit Village (population of 110). The recent program survey shows that the community is happy with the improvement and we plan to expand the program to the other village on the island.',

            "Beyond Borders helps people build movements to liberate themselves from oppression and isolation.  In Haiti and the United States, we are bringing people together for just and lasting change.\n\nWe support movements in Haiti to end child slavery, guarantee universal access to quality primary education, end violence against women and girls, and replace systems that oppress the poor with systems that support dignified work and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nWe see in Haiti, the seed for a new world, a world where, people overcome great challenges by learning to question, dream, and act together; women and men find more power by balancing power equally; families and communities thrive on foundations of trust and mutual respect; diversity is seen as a sign of strength; all children grow up surrounded by people who love, nurture, and educate them; we all find deeper meaning in our lives by coming to value truth over comfort, sharing over having, and justice over personal gain.\n\nBeyond Borders was founded in response to the challenge of Jesus' words and life of radical love. In all we do we attempt to measure our success by this standard. We welcome all, regardless of their faith, who will join us in supporting these movements for liberation. We find strength and wisdom in the dialogue that diversity allows.\n\nWe make a real difference in Haiti because of the approach we take. We follow the Haitian proverb that says, \"The rock in the water doesn't understand the misery of the rock in the sun.\" We work hand-in-hand with the Haitian people, understanding that they know how to best address the issues they face. We provide them with the resources they need to build grassroots, community-based movements that lead to sustainable, positive change.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about our work, the difference we're making, and how you can get involved. You may think that the needs are too great, but you are more powerful than you know. Even the smallest act can make a big difference. We're looking forward to working with you!",

          "On Lagonav Island in Haiti, we're working to help the very poorest rural families escape extreme poverty. These families are especially vulnerable, often with young children and no means of support. Women lead most of these households, and they are often isolated from their neighbors, destitute, with hardly any shelter and little or no means to feed, clothe, and educate their children. We are determined to help these families permanently escape extreme poverty and reclaim their dignity.",
        longTermImpact:
          "Since 2016, Beyond Borders' Family Graduation Program has empowered 231 families in 7 communities to escape extreme poverty. Of the most recent cohort to graduate: 100% of families prepare at least one cooked meal per day; 100% of their children go to school; 87% planted vegetable gardens; 100% have at least two income-generating activities; 94% participate in savings programs; 99% have safe, dignified housing; and 97% have a plan for the future to keep their families out of extreme poverty.",
        activities:
          "We're using an approach called The Graduation Model, proven globally to help families lift themselves out of extreme poverty in 18 months. Each family receives: assets to earn a living with, for example livestock, or goods to start a small store; training to manage the assets and start saving; initial cash support to reduce the need to sell their assets in an emergency; weekly coaching visits to reinforce skills, and build confidence; and access to healthcare so they can stay healthy and work.",

Local species, many of which are endangered, will be able to move between previously isolated patches.

          "The Lewa Children's Home provides orphans and vulnerable children with food, shelter, medical care, first-class education and a loving family environment. Thanks to an integrated model which includes a farm and a school, Lewa is a thriving model of self-sustainability. From the most heart-wrenching beginnings, children at Lewa are nurtured to become happy, healthy, responsible and independent members of society. We need your help to keep caring for these children who have nowhere else to go.",

          "Abandoned and orphaned children are assigned to Lewa by the justice court.  Some of them were abandoned at birth at the hospital, out of desperation, often because of illnesses or disabilities the parents couldn't cope with, or they are brought in by good Samaritans who noticed them living alone in the streets, being abused or neglected. All of them have heart-wrenching stories no child should go through, trauma and medical conditions requiring round-the-clock care, especially at the beginning.",

          'Thanks to your support, we will be able to continue caring for these vulnerable children, providing them with top-quality education and equipping them to become the leaders of tomorrow. Thanks to the Baraka farm, which provides food and income for the children, Lewa has become a model of self-sustainable development, inspiring many in the region and all over the continent.',
        activities:
          "Phyllis Keino started taking care of destitute children in the 1970s. Although they are other Children's Home in Kenya, none compares with Lewa. Lewa provides the love of a caring family environment and the structure and balance children need to flourish and become independent members of society. The farm and the school make it self-sustaining. In addition to the dozens orphans in her care (sometimes up to 100), Phyllis provides school sponsorships to vulnerable children from the community.",
